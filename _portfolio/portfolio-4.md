* End to End Encryption Protocol

    * This project implements an end-to-end encryption protocol.

    * The following was achieved:

        *  Ensured that all client communications are facilitated exclusively via the server, prohibiting direct inter-client exchanges.
        *   Implemented mutual authentication between clients and the server for improved security.
        *   Designed the system in such a way that the server remains unaware of the established session key, enhancing privacy.
        *   Utilized RSA encryption algorithm to securely exchange random nonces between clients, which are subsequently used to generate a mutually agreed session key to be used with AES algorithm.

* Please read ProjectDocumentation.pdf

    * It contains explanation of the e2e protocol.
* Please read installation.txt

    * It contains installation instructions.
