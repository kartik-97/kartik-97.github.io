* This project is done by creating a lab environment on VM Ware. There is a small network system of
several systems with different Operating System versions connected through internal network
considered as the company’s internal network and also connected to the internet. Penetration Testing
is about trying to get into the organization through agreed upon testing tools. This project is
completed in 5 major phases:
    * Foot printing and Reconnaissance: Reconnaissance is the act of gathering preliminary data or
    intelligence on your target. The data is gathered in order to better plan for your attack.
    Reconnaissance can be performed actively (meaning that you are directly touching the target)
    or passively (meaning that your recon is being performed through an intermediary).
    * Network Scanning and Service Enumeration:The phase of scanning requires the application of
    technical tools to gather further intelligence on your target, but in this case, the Intel being
    sought is more commonly about the systems that they have in place. A good example would
    be the use of a vulnerability scanner on a target network.
    * OS Fingerprinting:Operating System (OS) fingerprinting is the process of learning what
    operating system is running on a target device.
    * Gaining Access:Phase 3 gaining access requires taking control of one or more network
    devices in order to either extract data from the target, or to use that device to then launch
    attacks on other targets.
    * Covering Tracks: The final phase of covering tracks simply means that the attacker must take
    the steps necessary to remove all semblance of detection. Any changes that were made,
    authorizations that were escalated etc. all must return to a state of non-recognition by the host
    network’s administrators.
